# Binary Classification: Comparing 6 Models
Final project for Artificial Intelligence-Driven Decision Making.

To apply transfer learning for a binary classification task with a small dataset, various model architectures are discussed to understand their efficiency and the design decisions behind them. An experiment is conducted, and the results are analyzed.

Detailed code for dataset construction and the paper are available upon request.
