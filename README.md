# binary_classification_comparing_5_models
Final project of Artificial Intelligence Driven Decision Making.
To apply transfer traning for binary classification task with a small dataset, the architectures of various models are discussed, to better understand their efficiency and design decisions behind them. Then an experiment is conducted and the results are analysed.
